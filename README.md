# Optimization Algorithms

> Programmer: John Rommel B. Octavo

## Details:
These are the output programs for the CMSC 170 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. The algorithms are mainly focused on optimization. The simple genetic algorithm are used to solve the De Jong's Function for Optimization and the Travelling Salesperson Problem. The ant colony optimization was also used to solve the Travelling Salesperson Problem and the Schedulling of Aircraft Landings Problem.
